Wallpaper Switching Hotkeys

# How it Works
When you launch the program, you'll see a small window with a coloured box in it. When the box is red, it means you have unsaved changes. When it's green, the shortcut displayed is active.

You can minimize the application to the system tray. It will continue to work even when it's not in focus. It probably won't work from within some games with anti-cheat, but I haven't tested yet.

# Planned Features
- Quick ability to pause/resume listening to the desired hotkey from the system tray.
- A real icon, instead of one I ripped out of Windows.
- "Start with Windows" option.
- "Start Minimized" option.
